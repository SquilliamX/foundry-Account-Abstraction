## 🎯 Overview

This repository showcases a production-ready smart contract wallet implementation that leverages the power of Account Abstraction (AA) across traditional EVM chains. It demonstrates advanced blockchain patterns including:

- **Multi-Chain AA Support**: Seamless operation across EVM chains 
- **Gas Optimization**: Packed user operations and efficient signature validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% coverage with sophisticated test scenarios
- **Professional Deployment Pipeline**: Automated deployment with network-specific configurations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MinimalAccount.sol**
   - ERC-4337 compliant smart contract wallet
   - Modular signature validation system
   - Gas-optimized operation execution
   - Robust security checks with custom error handling

2. **EntryPoint Integration**
   - Seamless integration with the official ERC-4337 EntryPoint
   - Support for bundled transactions
   - Efficient gas handling and refund mechanisms

3. **Deployment & Configuration**
   - Network-aware deployment system
   - Automated contract verification
   - Environment-specific configurations

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Security Features
- Owner-based access control
- EIP-191 compliant signature validation
- Reentrancy protection
- Gas optimization for validation operations

### Gas Optimizations
- Packed user operations
- Minimal storage usage
- Optimized signature verification
- Efficient calldata handling

### OpenZeppelin Integration

This implementation leverages battle-tested OpenZeppelin contracts and libraries for maximum security and reliability:

- **Access Control**: Inherits from `Ownable` for secure owner-based access management
- **Cryptography**: Uses `ECDSA` and `MessageHashUtils` for robust signature validation
- **Token Standards**: Full ERC-20 compatibility for token operations
- **Security Patterns**: Implements OpenZeppelin's best practices for reentrancy protection and secure value transfers

The use of OpenZeppelin's audited, industry-standard contracts provides:
- ✅ Battle-tested security
- ✅ Gas-optimized implementations
- ✅ Standardized interfaces
- ✅ Regular security updates
